	\section{Document purpose}
	This document contain a brief description of the application showing the main concepts, we haven't gone in a deep application design yet so something could change during the development.
	
	\section{Main goal TODO}
	
	Help apartment mates to deal with the daily domestic problems such as payments, failures, timetables etc...
	
	\section{Application functions TODO}
	
		\subsection{Basic functionality}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Payment manager
			\item Failures report 
			\item Organize custom timetables
			\item Indicate anything on a "master" apartment calendar 
			\item Missing stuff
		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Other functionality}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Report the apartment presence periods 
			\item Ask for an apartment zone to remain empty for a certain period 
		\end{itemize}

	\section{User interface}
	
	Follows a list of all the possible screens.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Login/sign up screen};
		\item \textbf{Join/create apartment screen -} in which the user can join an apartment 
		or can create a new one.
		\item \textbf{Main screen -} made by a "tab" navigation, follows a list of each tab content:  
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Notifications tab} - in which are listed all the notifications, 
			differently labeled according to the their type;
			\item \textbf{New action tab} - where the user can handle all the functionalities
			the application offer, selecting one of those. Selecting one action a new specific screen
			will be show to the user;
			\item \textbf{Calendar tab} - shows a "monthly" calendar where are marked different types of events;
			\item \textbf{Profile tab -} shows profile, apartment and settings information.
		\end{itemize}
			
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Development framework}
	We have decided to adopt \textbf{React Native} for the application development.

	\section{Server connection}
	
	The application will have a connection to an external server which main function is storing users data.
	Probably we are going to exploit one of many cloud services such as Firebase.
